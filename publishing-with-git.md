# Publishing with Git

## What

Hi, I am Ey√∞un Nielsen from Statistics Faroe Islands . I work in the IT department with some development and also a lot of operations... I think there is some fancy new term for that nowadays. DevOps 

## Why

No, but in a statistical office in another country in the neigbourhood - waaaay back in the year 2015 - in the Faroe Island, we had a neglected PXWeb2008 server running in a DMZ zone serving px-files for Statistics Faroe Islands.

Every morning she came in to the office and sat and looked at her clock untill it was 9:30

And then she manually copied the px-files out to the PXWeb server so that they got published on time.

And sometimes errors occurred - and even sometimes that much, that I somehow got involved in looking for pxfiles in some backup .

And sometimes Simona was away - like on holiday - and again somehow I got involved... And I had to meet at the office before 9:30!


Something had to be done.

We knew that we needed a bit more of control over the px-files and some automation of the publising process.
